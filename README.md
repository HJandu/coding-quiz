## Background

As I proceed in my journey to becoming a front-end web developer, itâ€™s likely that I will be asked to complete a coding assessment, perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment is a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges. 

To help me become familiar with these tests and give me a chance to apply the skills, I have built a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I have written. It has a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. The timed quiz stores the high scores details, so that anyone can gauge their progress compared to their peers.


## Features

The coding quiz features the following:

 * A start button that when clicked (see above image), a timer starts and the first question appears.
 
  * Questions contain buttons for each answer.

  * When the answer is clicked, the next question appears.<br>

  * The quiz ends when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.

  * When the game ends, it displays your score and gives you the ability to save your name and your score.
